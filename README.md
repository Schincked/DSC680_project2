# Tech Salary Analysis

## Research Questions:
- What are the average salaries for different experience levels?
- How do salaries vary by job title and location?
- What is the impact of remote work and company size on salaries?
- Are there significant differences in salaries across regions?
- What trends can be observed over time (e.g., from 2023 to 2024)?

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze tech salaries based on various factors such as experience level, job title, location, remote work, and company size. The analysis also explores salary trends over time.

## Data
The data used for this analysis is stored in the `data/global_tech_salary.txt` file.

## Notebooks
The main analysis is performed in the Jupyter Notebook located at `src/dsc680_schincke_project2.ipynb`.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:
- `polars`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (including `train_test_split`, `RandomForestRegressor`, `mean_squared_error`, `r2_score`, `GridSearchCV`, and `cross_val_score`)

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
2. Open the `src/dsc680_schincke_project2.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Results
The results of the analysis, including visualizations and insights, are documented within the notebook.

## Presentation
A presentation summarizing the findings is available in the `powerpoint/dsc680_schincke_project2.pptx` file.
